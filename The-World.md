# The World of Avrilax #

Death is not a natural part of the "life" cycle on Avrilax and never has been.  

There is no illness, disease, or old age.  

If a living thing has a point where it reaches maturity, it is at this point that that creature also stops aging.

If a living thing continues to grow until it dies, then it continues to grow until it is killed.

Neglecting ones health can still kill you.  You can still starve or die of a heart attack or bleed to death.

Death is final.  Once you die there is no resurrection.  Upon death bodies are either burned or, if the body is undiscovered, they decay.  Some cultures in the world of Avrilax believe that when a field lies fallow for 2 years that it is good for the soil to place their dead in that field during the first year and let them naturally decay.  This enriches the soil with the nutrients from the body as it decays.  In these communities the fields are unplanted for 2 years then they are planted for 8 years in a row before they lay fallow again.

Avrilax is populated by the same creatures as Earth is and those creatures are very similar to how they are on Earth.  There also just happens to be a great many more than just those from Earth.

Avrilax will most likely only include the iconic monsters.  There are no Undead since every culture in Avrilax burns their dead.  Monsters would have the same growth and "life" cycle alterations as everything else though.

Monsters are no more stupid, as a whole, than the "civilised" races on Avrilax.  There are stupid Orcs but there are also advanced engineers.  It is possible to speak theology with the right Goblin.  The major difference between the "civilised" races and the monster races is their outlook.  The "civilised" races try to live in harmony and coexist with each other.  The monster races have a more dominant/dominating mind set and tend towards conquest and force.

There are no gods in Avrilax.  Some cultures around the world do worship things of a Pagan nature, which is more paying homage to your planet and respecting nature, but there are no entities in the "heavens" ruling over the world.  Over the ages, some gods have appeared and watched, but they quickly lose interest when they realize that the residents of Avrilax have no souls to barter for.

# Children of Avrilax #

Avrilax is a deity as well as a planet.  Because of this other deities and demons won't venture close enough to stake any kind of claim.

People don't procreate on Avrilax.  The planet produces new children and everyone helps raise them and look after them.

The planet created Humans, Elves, Dwarves, Orcs, Goblins and everything else, it doesn't see any of them as bad, just different.

Man learned arcane magic, it was not given.  This means that all Arcane casters are Wizard, not Sorcerer, Sorcerers don't exist.

People see this balance (for the most part) and so they place no barriers between the planet and the dead.  They give them back to the planet, allowing them to be absorbed into the planet and provide nourishment.

## Story ##

Some time ago man discovered magic.  The planet/god didn't care about this, but didn't aid the process either.  Initially the rest of man kind was in awe of Wizards.

As time goes on wizards get better and better.  Then, by accident, Necromancy (name?) is discovered.  The ability to raise the dead and deprive the planet of the end of a life cycle.  

Shortly after that, certain Wizards hunt for battle fields and places where the newly dead can be found to practice their Necromantic magic.

Once Necromancers were found playing with the dead they were shunned and the stories spread like wildfire.  Necromancers gathered en mass and built a city (not named yet).  In this city they discovered that if the dead are interred, kept from direct contact with the planet, that they don't decompose as fast and they don't ever go back to Avrilax.  This allowed them to practice away from others and away from persecution.

Initially there were tales of them stealing people to keep until they died so that they had more bodies...  Or that the city was a dark and evil place.....  Neither was the case.  Necromancers discovered that with the creation of the city that the planet provided a birth place for them as well, just like any other city.  The city is a very cultured place and enjoys much laughter.  The only difference is that they inter their dead.  Their lives are like any others on Avrilax though.

Magic is one thing, but keeping the dead from their return in the cycle, that is something else entirely..  That the planet could not condone this, but neither could it directly interfere with this problem.  

So, the planet created the Clerics, whose existence is about balancing the Necromancers and stopping them when possible.  They can rebuke undead, and heal those that would aid in the fight.  They are mainly fighter-type with some abilities aimed at the stopping of Necromancers and their work.

By its nature, the planet must produce life in the Necromancer city as well, no matter how the Necromancers handle their dead

The problem the Clerics face is that the Necromancers had a fortified city to defend themselves in before the Clerics were created.  So, to totally do away with the Necromancers the Clerics would have to storm their city en mass.  The magic necessary to see this through would be enough to destroy parts of the planet and the Clerics understand this, so they stand ready for if ever the Necromancers try to leave their city.

At that time even the planet will condone the Clerics use of magic to stop the spread of Necromancy.  Their are already 2 barren spots on the planet that are the result of the last 2 times the Necromancers tried to do just that in the past.

# Geography #
Avrilax mostly consists of land mass of various types (deserts, swamps, mountains, etc.) with 3 major inland seas and a huge number of lakes with rivers throughout the land.  There are forests both beautiful and dark.  There are mountains that reach high and caverns deep.  There are vast deserts and seas that will leave you with no land in sight for days.  There are grassy plains and treacherous swamps.  Avrilax is a place of both wonder and terror.

The fact that Avrilax is more land than water means that there is less cloud cover and there further you get between the seas the less storms and could cover there will be.

The axis of Avrilax is tilted, like Earth's own, meaning that there are seasons on Avrilax.

I will draw up a map of the world and post it here for all to see, I'm still working on that though.
