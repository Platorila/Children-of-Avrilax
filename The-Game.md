# System #

I will most likely be using a dice pool system for most of the dice rolling throughout the game.

## Die System ##

These are the terms that I will be using to describe die results.

*Fail - A fail coming up on a die roll does not necessarily mean that you fail at what you were attempting, unless you get enough of them.

*Success - A success coming up on a die roll does not necessarily mean that you succeed at what you were attempting, unless you get enough of them.

*Killer Success - A killer success means that you get to count that success and roll that die again for the chance at another success, this can happen multiple times consecutively.  If your re-roll comes up as a killer fail (see below) it will cancel out the previous success, even if it is the killer success that you just rolled.

*Killer Fail - A killer fail will cancel out a killer success if any were rolled, if not then it cancels out a success.  If there are no Successes then nothing happens.

I have yet to decide whether I will be using a specific size die system or a mixed system that depends on the action being performed.

I am also seriously considering  making the "killer" results fall in the middle of whatever size die I decide to use.  A d10 example is below.

Fail       1-4<br>
Killer F    5<br>
Killer S    6<br>
Success    7-10

And here is a d20 example

Fail       1-8<br>
Killer F    9 & 10<br>
Killer S    11 & 12<br>
Success    13-20

I am still very much working on this.

# Attributes #

There are so many systems that work, each in their own way.  Still mostly torn on how to approach this.

# Races #

Hobbits/Halflings do not exist on Avrilax.  The only short playable races are Gnomes and Dwarves.

There are no half-breeds.  Biologically, nothing on Avrilax can breed with a member of another race and produce offspring.

I'm considering having each race have at least 1 special evolution, or a change from what they traditionally are.  

## Dwarves ##

Dwarves stand no taller than 4'6", but can be found to be as short as 3'6", and are most recognizable from the front by their beards, which they will never cut by choice (see below).  From behind they are recognizable by their spikes that cover their backs and arms (see Evolution).

Their age can usually be determined by beard length as well as the gray VS color ratio in it.

If a Dwarfs beard is cut by an enemy in combat, that Dwarf will usually go into hiding until their beard is at least 6" to a 1' long before they will be seen publicly again.  

If a Dwarfs beard has been cut as a punishment, then it is an acknowledged matter of having dishonored ones person, family or clan somehow.  Other Dwarves will go to great lengths to avoid a beardless Dwarf, sometimes becoming hostile simply to not be seen in contact with one.  These Dwarfs are usually on the path of redemption.  Nothing will stop one of these Dwarves from clearing their honor.

### Evolution ###

Dwarves have a large number of bony protrusions on their backs that grow out and then curve down, ending in a sharp point, making a scale-like armor when they are standing up and making them more like a porcupine when curled up.  These spikes start at their shoulders and extend all the way down their backs to their tail bones, as well as covering the  outside of their arms down to their knuckles and they also cover the front of their shins.  

I haven't decided if they will be different colors or all the same or possibly have designs that may or may not be related to clan/family.

Breaking them will injure the Dwarf to a minor degree, but not enough to stop him, in fact, it will usually enrage him.  

These spikes can be used in many different defense and attack tactics, depending on how creative the Dwarf is.

## Elves ##

Elves come from different environments (e.g. woods, cities and snow-scapes).

### Evolution ###

Elves are natural born were-creatures.  What creature they turn into is dependent on the environment their clan lives in and possibly also dependent on their geographical region.  This would mean that even though there may be 3 different tribes of Elves (just an example) that all live in the woods (possibly even in the same woods) they would all change into different animals that also live in the woods.

The forms these were-creatures can take includes the Elf and the Animal forms, as well as an upright, slightly Elven version that has traits of the creature as well, this form is called the Mesh form.

The animal type that each clan changes into will have certain changes for their Elven form as well.  Things like, a Bear-Elf would be taller and broader than the typical Elf, whereas a Spider-Elf would be more bulbous and round shaped with thin limbs.  Their creature type will not give them any extra attacks or special abilities related to the creature, it is strictly cosmetic.

Or I might do away with the region dependency and make it so that each clan has a mix of creatures from that environment, with each creature type filling a different role in the clan (Warriors, scouts ans such).  Though I do like the thought of having the Elvish creature clans.  We shall see.

## Gnomes ##

Gnomes have an innate and uncontrollable ability that can save them from danger in most situations.  This ability is a very limited teleportation ability that they can't actually control.  Whenever a Gnome is alerted to imminent danger by one of its 5 senses its survival instincts teleport it up 10 feet in a direction that seems to be safer on a subconscious level.  This teleportation cannot put the Gnome in or even through a wall.  If they happen to be touching/holding a loose object not actively attended by another creature or type of magic then that object is teleported with them.

During combat this can only happen once per 10 rounds at lower levels.  

As the Gnome gets older and more experienced this can happen more and more frequently, but the distance teleported never changes.  I might make it so that at very high levels they get an added ability similar in nature that can save the Gnomes life by teleporting him/her to a safe place that the Gnome designates, but this can only happen once per week.

## Humans ##

Humans are very versatile.  Due to their versatility, their evolutions are varied as well.  Due to this versatility, I am still trying to come up with the various evolutions of humans.

### Evolutions ###

The evolutions of Humans are all based on enhancements to their own chemical makeup.

The main elements that make up a Human are oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, calcium, and phosphorus.  I am going to attempt to make an Evolution per element in this list.

##### Gravitars #####

The Gravitars are a group of evolutions for Humans that fit into a single category. Every type of Gravitar manifests his own innate control of magnetism in different ways and all producing different effects.

All Gravitars have a skeletal system that is made of jointed magnets, through an innate control of the electrical charge in their brains they can change the polarity of their skeletal system.  There are different ways to use these magnetic fields and this is why there are different types of Gravitars.

##### Shapers #####

Shapers focus their control of magnetism to rearrange metal, to a limited degree.  They cannot make a pile of metal bigger, but, as their name implies, they can shape it into something useful, such as armor or a weapon.  

Shapers must touch the metal they are working with.  

In the early stages of their growth it can take some time to get the desired results.  During the final stages of their growth they can repair a breastplate in a single round.

This ability does not grant them the ability to replace magic effects stored in an item.  If a magical item is broken, all a shaper can do is make it back into the type of item it once was, without the magical effects.

##### Slingers #####

Slingers use magnetism to propel a metal object or objects in a chosen direction away from themselves, essentially turning metal objects into projectiles.

In their early stages, a Slinger can only effect a single small object, about the size of a dagger, out to a distance of 10 ft.  As they level up and work more with the ability, they gain more finite control with multiple small objects and also start being able to manipulate larger metal objects.

##### Carbonites #####

The body of a Carbonite contains so much carbon that it has infused their skin, which gives their bodies a dark gray and slightly reflective quality, but it also provides a natural armor.  At eaarly levels their skin is like graphite and as they level it hardens until it is the consistency of diamond.

## Sorcerers ##

Sorcerer is going to be a race on Avrilax.

Sorcerers are between 6'6" and 7'6" tall and weigh between 200 and 250 Lbs.  They appear human in shape, but they have glossy black eyes with no other coloring at all, Sharp teeth designed for eating meat and they have very thick and durable 3 inch long claws on their finger tips.  

Sorcerers have no hair from the neck down, but they do have facial hair and can grow hair on their heads.  Their skin tone and hair color varies just as much as a humans does.

Their primary diet is meat, but they are not scavengers or cannibals.  They do not eat anything they don't kill for themselves and they prefer cooked meat to raw meat.  They won't even hunt unless it necessary for survival and they disdain unnecessary killing or violence.

They are typically a gentle race even though they are capable of great fury and can be deadly combatants.  Most people are terrified by their appearance and will normally attack Sorcerers on site or run away, out of biased fear, it the person is not accustomed to their appearance.

Another defining characteristic for a Sorcerer is the fact that it looks as though they have something burrowing under their skin.  Actually, this is the magic that they are born with coursing through their bodies.  These burrows constantly change as if they were made by a living entity that lives under their skin.  These burrows are different colors for each Sorcerer.  In the dark, these burrows glow softly, making it difficult for a sorcerer to hide in the dark.  This glow is not enough to help with seeing anything beyond arms length.  For creatures with Night Vision, these burrows still appear to be the color that they are in normal vision.

I haven't yet decided what will determine which color each has or if it will be random.  I also don't know if I will make the color change over time, possibly to mark the growth of the Sorcerer.

Sorcerers have no sex.  They do not physically reproduce on their own.  The magic inside them creates and helps them birth their children.  They are very community driven and they all help in the raising of all of the children born in the community.

## Wizards ##

Wizard is going to be a race on Avrilax.

# Skills #

Skills are common things that everyone can attempt, such as climbing, jumping, riding and sneaking.

I am considering a percentile based system for skills.  At character creation you can chose where to allocate your percentages.  After that you have to use them to get better at them.  

Up until %30 - %50 (not sure exactly yet) you actually gain in skill from both successes and failures, just at different rates.  After the target % is reached then you will only gain from successes.

# Feats #

Not sure if I will even use Feats.

Feats are special abilities that give a character that special edge.

# Equipment #

This chapter will cover equipment statistics and services offered, as well as the purchasing system.

## Purchasing System ##

This system has yet to be determined.

I'm thinking a barter system or a system based on weight of materials in + a service charge VS goods out....  Unsure

## Automail ##

Avrilax has Engineers that have discovered how to craft fully functional replacement limbs for those in need.  These replacement limbs are connected to the existing nervous system in a procedure that is so painful that some have died during its execution.  

Engineers are a very close organization that guard their secrets from any outsiders.  They have an unwritten agreement among them that Automail is for those that need it, not those that want it.  They will refuse to do the procedure on anyone they feel is requesting it for the wrong reasons.

There is only one place to have this procedure done.  It is also the only place to learn to become an Engineer.  This place is located in a mountain range.  The only way to access the only door is to climb a switch back trail for almost a mile.  The only known way to get through the door at the top is to have an Engineer let you in.

## Magic ##

This section will explain how the different character types interact with Magic in the world.

There is no spells per day system.

There is still a spells known system.

### Sorcerers ###

All Sorcerers start with an altered version of Quicken Spell.  The alteration is that they get the benefit of the ability without having to alter the RT of the 2nd spell cast that round.  They can take Quicken Spell more than once.  This 2nd time is not something they get automatically and the RT modification does apply to the 3rd spell cast in that round.  Another thing to keep in mind, Any spell cast follows the rules outlined in the explanation in the Spells section (below) as far as what can be cast in the same round and having to wait for the RT to pass after the casting.

### Wizards ###

Wizards know more spells than a Sorcerer, but cannot fire them off at such a rapid pace.  They get a familiar.

# Spells #

This section will cover the possible systems that I am dreaming up for how Spells work.

Bear with me on this aspect, this is going to be a system I am coming up with on my own and, though it was the first thing I started, it will most likely be the last one I finish.

## Option 1 ##

Spell casting uses a system called Recovery Times (RT).  The RT of a spell is equal to the number of rounds between each casting.  A 0 RT spell can be cast every round and a 1 RT spell can be cast every other round.  A 5 RT spell can be cast every 6 rounds.

I am still determining how many RTs there will be. Initially I was going to have 10 RTs (0-9).  But I realized that while a 9 RT spell is very powerful, by the time you would gain access to them you would need them more often than every 10 rounds.

Below are the things I am considering using for the RT mechanism  

If you cast an RT3 spell, you cannot cast another RT3 spell until the counter for the first counts down.  

*Meaning that it isn't just that spell that is inaccessible during the RT, but all spells of that RT are on a cool down.  I have already considered revising this as it seems too crippling.  

The solution I was considering is once the spells are broken into their RTs, break them down again into elements (Elemental, Necromantic, Force and so on) and say that you can cast multiple spells from the same RT without effecting the entire RT.  An example, You cast an RT3 Necromancy spell, all RT3 Necromancy spells have to wait to be cast again, but you could still cast an RT3 Elemental spell or a spell of a different RT all together.

## Option 2 ##

At character creation, you chose 1 main category of spells and 2 minor categories.  

An example would be, Major = Fire and Minor = Change(?) and Creation.  This character would start with a useful, but slightly weak, Fire spell (that only effects a single target), a spell for changing the sensory inputs received by the target of the spell (making foot steps sound like dripping water and such, though the targets other senses can ruin the deception) and a spell that allows him to create cheap armor or weapons, but not both at this point (these would be weaker than if they owned the same equipment made by conventional means, at this point).  Then, as they gain levels these spells would get stronger and take on different uses.  Fire would do more damage, catch enemies on fire, explode on impact and such.  Change would possibly become able to change the appearance of certain things eventually maybe even bestowing the ability to become invisible.  Creation would make better armor weapons and possibly allow for certain magical effects to be placed on created equipment, or it would allow for the creation of a feast and who knows what else.

Keep in mind that the above example is an "on-the-spot" example.  These are not the final thoughts just me explaining a  way that this '''could''' work.

I really like this system and will work on this a little more.

### Spell List ###

These are not organized the way that I will wind up having them.  

There most definitely will not be 17 RTs.  
I will be dividing them up differently, there won't be Abjuration, Conjuration and all that junk.  
I am considering splitting the spells between Sorcerers and Wizards so that they are mostly separate lists.

I just had an interesting idea, what about making it so that once you have chosen your spells for that level there is no learning from that levels list again until level 18 or higher.  This would most likely entail changing the system since I have already said, and still maintain, that there will not be RT 17 spells.
